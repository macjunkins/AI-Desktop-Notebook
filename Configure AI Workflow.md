# Summary

I'm updating my developer workflow to integrate various AI models and tools. My goal is to organize data and streamline
my environment. Currently, I have a data download form (markdown docs + `.json`), and I'm considering using Rust/Tauri
for automation, but need to focus on setting up my workflow first.
